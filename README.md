SimpleClock, SC in short, is a macOS application which can bring basic time functions but with better user experience. This app is fully built with Swift 3.0 in Xcode on High Sierra platform. 
<br>

## Function
### 1. Time Showing
Because macOS doesn't have an application called "Clock", each time I called Siri to show me the time in Guangzhou or other places, I find it hard to make the robot to understand "Guangzhou" but not "Guam Joe". So, I built this app for time showing.
This app is of the latest design of Apple on Mac, such as Blurry Background, Multi-Touch Bar, etc.. And I make it into this app.

SimpleClock can change between Hour-Minute Mode and Hour-Minute-Second Mode by clicking the time. And you can also change it by switching the toggle on your Macbook Pro Multi-Touch Bar. You can change the theme by clicking the upper-right corner of the window. What's more, you can also change the 12/24H with your touch bar.

### 2. Timer & Stopwatch
Because the Timer and Stopwatch are also important in our daily life, SimpleClock will make them in the future. The pictures of Timer and Stopwatch are here:

And in Timer, I designed a Progressbar to show the position of the time. What's more, if you input the time like 100 seconds, the Timer will correct the mistake automatically. 
These functions can be called by clicking SimpleClock->Timer or SimpleClock->Stopwatch. These windows are also with the design features. You can use it as your working timer or life stopwatch.
<br>

### 3. Fullscreen
When you toggle the fullscreen, the app will become a locker-like application. And this make your MBP into a "Big iPad".

### 4. Multi-Touch Bar Function
As an application designed on High Sierra, SimpleClock provides several Touch Bar functions. With Multi-Touch Bar, we can give some settings to the app.
